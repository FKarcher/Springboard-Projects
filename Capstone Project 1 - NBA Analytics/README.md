# Capstone Project 1 - Comparing European and American NBA Centers

# Background/Context
The NBA has become more and more 'international' in recent years as teams have started drafting international players more often. EU Centers, or 'European Big Men'
as they are sometimes referred to within NBA circles, have proven themselves as valuable assets and with the decreased stigma of drafting international players 
it has become, and will continue to be, very relevant to make the right choice when choosing which player to draft.

## The Goal
The goal of this Capstone Project is to compare the strengths and weaknesses of NBA centers originating from the US and EU countries and to
create predictive models 'per game' statistics (Points, Assists, Rebounds, Steals and Blocks). In doing so the reader/beneficiery of this project will be more
informed in what to expect from a certain player or groups of players in terms of the oreviously mentioned statistics.

## The Audience
NBA Scouts, Coaches, General Managers, fans and even players themselves are potential audiences of this project.
