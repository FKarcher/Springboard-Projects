    "It should be noted that the most recent version of the Stanford Question Answering dataset (SQuAD 2.0) includes 'impossible questions' as denoted in the dataset's '*is_impossible*' column that was not part of the dataset in earlier versions. The reason for this (according to the SQuAD website) is to encourage research into Question Answering systems that can cope with un-answerable questions by not even attempting to answer them (by returning empty string outputs or else). Given the added complexity this brings to the project, you will see in the code below that I simply exclude 'impossible questions' in this project."

    "## Word Vectorization\n",
    "To be able to use words, phrases, questions or other natural language constructs in our model we require a to provide our neural network a numerical representation of our words (as these are the elemental NLP 'particles'). The simplest implementation would be to use 'one hot encoding' and define each word as a vector the size of our dictionary (the number of unique words found in our collection of documents, our corpus). However, this approach will most likely be insufficient for the purposes of a question answering system. word2vec and GloVe are 2 popular choices sophisticated options for word embeddings that also capture word similarities. I will not go into the details of either architecture other than to say that we will not be re-training the word vectors due to the insufficient size of the dataset, and we will begin with the GloVe word embeddings due to it's superior performance in most 'downstream' modelling tasks. Having said that, given the simplicity of swapping word vector representations we will also test out performance with word2vec (providing we can do so in a time-efficient manner).\n",

The GRU requires the input to be a 3D Tensor of shape (samples, timesteps, columns/features), and each sample must have the same (timesteps, columns/features) shape. However, given that our contexts are of different length (different amounts of words/timesteps), the embedded representations are padded (have 0.0s appended to each context embedding) as to meet the input requirements. As a technical side note, all embedded contexts are padded such that their length is equal to the length of the longest context in the whole sample (again, such that each individual sample has the same shape). To ensure that the GRU interprets the 0.0s as paddings, we mask the input (via the Masking layer). A Dropout Layer is added as a form of regularization. The *get_facts* method then returns the facts for each sample/context by extracting the hidden states/outputs of the GRU corresponding to 'end of sentence token' timesteps (exactly as described in the *'Ask Me Anything...'* paper."

    "- **What it does:** The task of the Episodic Memory Module (in simplified terms) is to take the Context and Question embeddings, returned by the Input and Question modules respectively, and a return the final memory representation to the Answer Module. There are many Attention Mechanisms and various implementation details so I will cover the details of the Episodic Memory Module used in this project in the final report.\n",
    "- **How it does it:** Again, in simplified terms, this Module can be thought of to contain 2 'parts'. An *'Attention Mechanism'* and a *'Memory Update Mechanism'*. Given the 'facts' returned by the Input Module (embedded representation of each sentence in the context) and the Question Module output (which is also an embedded representation, but this time of a single sentence, the question), the Episodic Memory Module chooses which parts of the inputs (facts) to focus on through the attention mechanism. It then produces a ”memory” vector representation taking into account the question as well as the previous memory. Each iteration provides the module with newly relevant information about the input. This acts as a form of transitive reasoning, by effectively allowing the module to re-pay attention to parts of the context that it found to be relevant to answering the question. "

Given the nature of the DMN (being modular and thus generalisable to many different types of tasks) once again there are many implementations of the Answer Module, and once again I will spare the details for the report and only give a brief outline.\n",
    "- **How it does it:** In this project we trained the network in a supervised setting. In the SQuAD dataset each answer is a span of the context meaning that the answer can be retrieved directly from the context as a continuous string. Thus the task of predicting the answer can be simplified to training the model to predict the start and end indices of the context, as this would allow us to directly extract the answer from the context. The objective/loss function is the sum of the categorical cross-entropy errors over the start/end index probability vectors (*start_idx_probs* and *end_idx_probs*.) "
