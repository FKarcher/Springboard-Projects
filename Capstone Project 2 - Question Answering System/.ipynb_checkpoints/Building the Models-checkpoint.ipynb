    "### Word Vectorization\n",
    "To be able to use words, phrases, questions or other natural language constructs in our model we require a to provide our neural network a numerical representation of our words (as these are the elemental NLP 'particles'). The simplest implementation would be to use 'one hot encoding' and define each word as a vector the size of our dictionary (the number of unique words found in our collection of documents, our corpus). However, this approach will most likely be insufficient for the purposes of a question answering system. word2vec and GloVe are 2 popular choices sophisticated options for word embeddings that also capture word similarities. I will not go into the details of either architecture other than to say that we will not be re-training the word vectors due to the insufficient size of the dataset, and we will begin with the GloVe word embeddings due to it's superior performance in most 'downstream' modelling tasks. Having said that, given the simplicity of swapping word vector representations we will also test out performance with word2vec (providing we can do so in a time-efficient manner)."
