Blurbs for Capstone Project Ideas

1.
In the era of environmental concern a topic that has been highly talked about has been that of the personal vehicle. Due to the diminishing supply
of crude oil and the emissions generated by Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) it’s in the governments’ and end-users’ interest that alternative fuels
are found to power our personal means of transportation (car, moped,  motorcycle or other) that have a minimal dependence on crude oil and contribute
as little as possible to the greenhouse effect. Electric vehicles have been marketed as the next big thing, however there are many other alternatives.
In this capstone project I will study trends in costs of various alternative fuel vehicle options and potentially answer the question 'Are electric 
vehicles the most viable out of all the alternative fuel options"

Education is an incredibly important aspect of personal development from a multitude of perspectives. Furthermore, education is used as a metric for 
determining nation-wide metrics such as the Better Life Index, Human Development Index etc. Generally speaking each of these indeces are evaluating the
level of development of nations and the 'Quality of Life' of its individuals. Since 2011 the 'World Happiness Report' has aimed to quantify 
the 'Quality of Life' in terms of happiness (which is seem by many as the ultimate life goal). The report associates a numerical score to each country
based on subjective and objective measures. However, the report does not factor in education. The aim of this Capstone project will be to study
the relationship between the 'education based metrics' and the happiness report score with the aim to test the hypothesis that education leads to happiness.

America is most obese country in the world (by number) and 19th by percentage. Over 109 million people have a BMI greater than 30 in the US. Needless to say
it would be beneficial to lower this amount. The aim of this Capstone project will be to analyze how the behavioural and nutritional factors affect obesity
rates and maybe even provide data driven recommendations that will aid reducing this amount.
